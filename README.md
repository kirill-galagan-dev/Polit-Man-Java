# Polit-Man:

A classic desktop arcade game inspired by Pac-Man, developed entirely in Java. 
This academic project was built to demonstrate a solid understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, custom GUI design, and 2D game loop mechanics.

## Features:
* **Classic Arcade Gameplay:** Navigate the maze, collect points, and outsmart the ghosts.
* **Custom Graphics:** Unique sprites and assets for characters, enemies, and UI menus.
* **Score Tracking:** Built-in high score system that persists across game sessions.
* **Interactive UI:** Fully functional Main Menu with Start, High Scores, and Exit options.

## Tech Stack:
* **Language:** Java (Core)
* **GUI Framework:** Java Swing & AWT (for 2D rendering and event handling)
* **Key Concepts:** OOP, File I/O (for resource loading and saving scores), Multithreading (for the game loop).
